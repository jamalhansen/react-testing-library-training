To open the roles notebook run

```

There are also notebooks for query functions and query criteria.

- query functions - get parts of the element to be tested (i.e. getBy..., findBy..., queryBy...)
- query criteria - second half of the query (i.e. ..Role(), LabelText(), ...TestId())

```bash
npx rtl-book serve query-notes.js
```

or

```bash
npx rtl-book serve criteria-notes.js
```
